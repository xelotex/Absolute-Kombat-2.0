Here you can create issues to Report bugs, ask questions and drop suggestions for the modpack.

Or you can also help me by giving me the following feedback:
1. General thoughts on the modpack.

2. Feelings on the healing system. Does it feel fair, engaiging, maybe too punishing?

3. Does combat feel balanced? Are there any weapons and armor that feel too strong/weak?

4. Do enemies feel challenging, without being frustrating? Do they have any abilities or mechanics that feel unfair? How does the enemy buffs after entering the Nether/End feel? too easy? too hard?

5. How do you feel about the inventory, is the inventorio mod easy to use and configure?

6. Any parts about your playthrough that you found to be the most fun or frustrating?
